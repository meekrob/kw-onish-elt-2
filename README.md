#### Pull in repositories with:

``
git subtree add --prefix=JM149_JM259_ELT-2_Promoter_Analysis git@github.com:izabella-mastroianni/JM149_JM259_ELT-2_Promoter_Analysis.git main
``

Which pulls the repo into a directory named by PREFIX. You then commit and push this.

It seems like you can just repeat this command if that repository is updated.
